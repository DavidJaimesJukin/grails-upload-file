We have used static scaffolding to generate the CRUD ( Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

[source, bash]
----
./grailsw generate-all Hotel
----

Moreover, we have done a code refactoring of the generated controller `HotelController` and we have extracted
the transactional GORM behavior to a service `HotelGormService`.

In order to keep this guide code listings short, we don't include those code snippets. However,
you can link:https://github.com/{githubSlug}/archive/master.zip[download] and unzip the source or clone this guide repository https://git-scm.com/[Git]: `git clone https://github.com/{githubSlug}.git`
You can find the finished guide with all the project code at `{githubSlug}/complete`
